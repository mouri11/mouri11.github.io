            <p> <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, running on Ruby. Jekyll harnesses the power of markdown, which makes writing HTML much easier and much more efficient. You can look it up on Google to look around at some very cool websites made using Jekyll.</p>

            <p>Passions was a long thought-of project of mine. I meant to make a blogging platform, where I could post articles, stories, etc for the world to see. Since Jekyll is so easy to understand and manipulate, it took me just a couple of days to get my blog up and running. Being hosted on Github Pages, which also uses Jekyll, and since Github is also its creator, this blog hosts my stories, travelogues, articles I like from around the web and more. Feel free to look around.</p>
