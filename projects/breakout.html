            <p> BlogIt is a blogging platform complete with signup,login, upvote and downvote features. It was built using AngularJS, Bootstrap and Stamplay. <a href="https://stamplay.com">Stamplay</a> is a hosting service, also providing back-end solutions for websites.</p>

            <p> This website was built over the course of 6 weeks, as a project for Internshala Summer Training on AngularJS. The website was hosted using the trial period of Stamplay services, which unfortunately is very short. Hence the website isn't available on public domain. However, you can check out the works <a href="https://github.com/mouri11/Projects/tree/master/blogit" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
