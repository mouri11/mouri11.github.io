            <ul id="slider1">
              <li><img src="/img/tabcalc/pic1.png" title="Fragment Activity: Normal Calcualator" "/></li>
              <li><img src="/img/tabcalc/pic1.png" title="Fragment Activity: Scientific Calculator" /></li>
            </ul>

            <p> Tabcalc was my first stint in making Android apps and trying out new things. It turned out to be much better than i expected it to be. Although still under progress, the calculator has been made to be a lot like the handheld ones we still use. </p>

            <p> The black background is easy on the eye. The interface is easier on the user. To prevent users from being overwhelmed by the simple abundance of operations, the normal and scientific modes have been separated, with the ease to switch between either. One can keep entering their expressions until they want it to be evaluated.</p>

            <p> This introduction is meant for people with no or little programming background as well. Interested programmers can see my project <a href="https://github.com/BytesClub/Tabcalc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
