<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello everyone!! I am very excited to tell you that after long days of laziness and resulting self-loathing, I finally managed to set up this blog.</p>

In case we are meeting for the first time, my name is Rohit Das. I am a CSE undergrad, very under-qualified, lazy and - oh, sorry. Self-loathing mode of mine.

This blog was started with the intention of bringing people together, giving them a platform to express themselves or their talents in any way they want. Stories will be posted here. You can send me your stories at my mail mentioned on my website.

Looking forward to you all.
