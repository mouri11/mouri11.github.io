<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">R</span>eviews are something people like to be personal so that they could help themselves choose a product to suit their want or need (mostly want).</p>

Going out into the market and looking out for a product worth your time and money is difficult, frustrating and confusing. So was I when on the lookout for a phone within my budget but having the latest features. I didn't like Android phones quite much before, with all the degradation in performance I had observed in others' phones. Though Google has done well in improving the OS over time, hardware mattered to me as well, nerdy as I am (maybe not so much).

I came across Mi and their phones while browsing in an on-line commercial store. Their devices didn't look cheap, priced almost right and had the latest specifications, especially the Redmi line of Android phones. Having a metallic finish, they didn't disappoint me.

So, fingers crossed, I got myself a Redmi 3S Prime. Their stocks never lasted on the commercial websites for long, so took me some time to get my hands on one. The first thing I noticed was the sturdy metal body, which made it almost feel very classy. Tagged at 8999, this phone packed a lot of features. Google can go about babbling out those for you. Here, I'm going to write my experience with it.

The phone heats up if used for too long, while charging, or in the heat of summer, especially with a transparent phone cover. It had malfunctioned for a second on two occasions, but recovered on reboot. Also, with the hybrid slot, you can have either two SIM cars in it, or accommodate your favourite SD card, and remove the other SIM.

But (there's always a but), the user interface is awesome. It can be customized to one's own whim, and doesn't break down. It's pretty fast, hasn't slowed down yet, and doesn't need extra anti-virus apps to keep it running properly. It also manages apps very well to utilize the maximum of a whopping 3gb RAM and a very fast processor (for the nerds: Qualcomm(R) Snapdragon(TM) 430, 64-bit quad core processor). The camera is pretty good, although low light pictures suck a bit. In-built filters are pretty cool.

So, wrapping it up, Redmi 3S Prime is one of the many cool and must-have phones Mi keeps belting out at prices to make you drool. Go for it, unless you are an Apple-head (I doubt that's even a word). Check it out <a href="http://www.mi.com/in/redmi3s/">here</a>.
