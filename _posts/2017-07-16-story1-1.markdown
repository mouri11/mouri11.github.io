<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>he had been running for a while now, her legs giving away under her “weight” (she hardly had any). But she must go on. She had to. There was no way she could look back, not with the baby in her. A dark past had been left behind, with a darker future ahead - or maybe not. Maybe the readers will be kind enough to think optimistically about what happens to her after this.</p>

Let’s go back a bit. No, a byte. Maybe a word will do. I guess 64-bits will do the trick. Sushnita had been too worked up lately. 10 assignments, 6 internals, the deadline being only 10 days away?! I myself couldn’t believe this while penning, I mean, digitizing this piece. Ah, well, engineers haven’t been known to be in a comfortable position anywhere in their awesome (read pathetic) lives. But Sushnita had managed to balance it all. Academics, parents, hobbies and a perfect, albeit shabby, love-life took up most of her time. She had been a very vociferous girl in her childhood. And teens. Well, she is still vociferous and speaks up a lot of trouble for herself. What? She was supposed to change? Become the silent type? And why is that? Adulthood? Apparently, she never grew up in her mind. Still the rebel.

"<em>But you were talking about her assignments</em>”. Yeah, I know. So, she was really struggling this time. Why? It was her last semester in the college, with the people she called friends, how they danced in the courtyard, sweet…. never mind. She was worried about her future now as she had never been. Jobs and recruitments are an all-time low in the country, and that was reason enough to upset her. Not that she didn’t have to pay the boarding rent on her own because her parents had separated, or that she didn’t suspect her fool of a boyfriend to be cheating on her; she had only her career in mind for now.

Apart from her woes and hoes, she taught young kids. She loved teaching. Her mom was a teacher (that was before the “Dad” abandoned ship; depression took over). She used to dote on her mom- every action of hers, every nuance of her humour had imprinted themselves on this struggling girl. It gave her something to live for. Life is harsh, unfair, and you got to have something to show you the rays in the cloudiest of days (You wish I were a poet!). She always managed to cut away some time from her precious hourglass for few of the kids who still loved her for what she had to offer, pure knowledge instead of rote learning (blame our professors for that).

6:30pm. It was raining. She was bored, distraught, tired from all the nonsensical assignments humping her day and night. Alik hadn’t called for a week (My girlfriend would have killed me…kidding). The fool of a boyfriend never cared much for her, except of course for her “assets”. Alik was a whore of a guy, breaking numerous hearts and hymens, and quite notorious for many a nuisance in the lives of others. But it took a girl like Sushnita to take a liking for him. “What? A girl like Sushnita can fall for a dud(e) like Alik?” You stereotyping maniacal whatever! Sushnita can fall for whoever she wishes to! Anyway, he thought he had managed to pick up the prettiest girl in the class. Of course, she was a gun waiting to go off at the smallest of issues, but she was smoking hot for Alik. Alik liked his girls wild, and she was wilder in the, umm, you know where, you dirty minded whatever. Although Alik had a small dick, so small that girls often asked if he had put it in, Sushi, as the fool ruined her beautiful name and called her so, never minded it. She was happy to satisfy Alik, and never minded much of his almost non-existent pee-pee. Well, not until today. Your stereotype got her, you pessimistic…never mind. She hadn’t cried in a while.

The rain pelted harder. She felt like she needed someone. She wished someone could hug her, strip her naked, get into her very soul and make love to it. She wished a hand, a finger, could run all over her body, make her shiver, make her feel less…alone. The Internet connection wasn’t working, and her collection of porn was stinking old. She leaned back. She eased her body. Relaxing. Feeling her existence. Putting her finger into her shorts, she wished to make the best of herself. She wanted to feel loved, special. Instead, she was bleeding. Her hands were soiled, and so were her new panties. And no one to love, care or cherish her-nothing to let her know that she was needed, that someone or something was there to hear her out. “<em>How do you know all this?</em>” Because I am the one writing this goddamn thing, fool! (and don’t judge me for that). The rain had come into her room, down her cheeks, along her beautiful neck Alik loved to kiss and lick, washing away all the Kajal she had painstakingly put around her doe eyes that evening. She was beautiful, and yet she wasn’t.
