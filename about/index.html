		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Hello there. Welcome to my portfolio. It is more like a summary of what I was and am. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Technology, specialising in Computer Science and Engineering(B. Tech in CSE for short) from <a href="https://wbut.ac.in">Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology(formerly WBUT)</a>. I am always working to improve myself, filling my repertoire of skills with relevant ones.</p>

	    <p>As you can see, I like to work on Web Development. You can also check out my blog. I have also worked extensively on the Android platform and built apps for it. Some of my projects are listed under the Projects tab.</p>
	    
	    <p>I completed my +2 from <a href="http://www.holy-home.com/">Holy Home School</a> in Serampore, my hometown. I completed my secondary education from <a href="http://www.dbbandel.org/">Don Bosco School, Bandel</a>, where I have studied for 10 years. It was a worthwhile experience.</p>

	    <p>Besides my academics, I read books I find interesting, watch worthwhile movies and play video games at my leisure. I also write on my blog - stories, travelogues, etc. I used to play the electronic piano and also played table tennis for a while. I love cycling and am a licensed two-wheeler rider.</p>
